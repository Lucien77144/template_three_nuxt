# Nuxt 3 and Three.js Starter

This template provides a starting point for building applications using Nuxt 3 and Three.js. It combines the powerful features of Nuxt for server-side rendering and routing with the 3D capabilities of Three.js.

## Credits

- **FlanB**: Some features are inspired by [flanb starter](https://github.com/flanb/threejs-vite-starter/tree/main).

## Overview

- **Nuxt 3**: A powerful framework for building Vue.js applications with server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library that makes creating 3D graphics in the browser easier.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`, where you can view your application in the browser.

## How It Works

1. **File Structure**: The template includes a standard Nuxt file structure, which organizes your components, pages, and assets.
2. **Routing**: Nuxt automatically generates routes based on the files in the `pages` directory.
3. **Three.js Integration**: You can create 3D scenes using Three.js within your Vue components, allowing for interactive and dynamic graphics.

## Understanding Abstracts

In the context of this template, **Abstracts** refer to reusable components or classes that encapsulate common functionality or behavior. They serve as a blueprint for creating more specific components or classes. Hereâ€™s how you can utilize abstracts in your project:

- **Creating Abstract Components**: Define components that contain shared logic or UI elements. For example, you might create an abstract `Base3DObject` component that includes common properties and methods for all 3D objects in your application.
- **Extending Abstracts**: Other components can extend these abstract components to inherit their functionality. This promotes code reuse and helps maintain a clean codebase.

- **Example Usage**: If you have multiple 3D objects with similar behaviors, you can create an abstract class that defines those behaviors, and then create specific classes for each object type that extend the abstract class.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

This command compiles your application into a production-ready version.

## Previewing the Production Build

To locally preview the production build, run:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm run preview

# yarn
yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```

This allows you to test the production build before deploying it.

## Deployment

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information on how to deploy your application to various hosting platforms.

## Conclusion

This template serves as a foundation for building applications with Nuxt 3 and Three.js. You can extend it by adding your own components, pages, and 3D scenes to create a unique application.
